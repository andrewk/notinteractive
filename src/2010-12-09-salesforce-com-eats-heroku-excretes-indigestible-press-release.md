I realise being a Hater 2.0 is so very 2006, but when I read [Salesforce.com’s Heroku acquisition press release][1] this morning it blew my tiny little mind all over my cereal. What on Earth? I love a bit of Leveraging Enterprise Buzzword Linguistic Synergies™, but even on my best day I couldn’t hope to achieve such a perfect cacophony of puff and bullshit.

Now obviously that press release wasn’t written for me. While [we’ve][2] [been][3] [using][4] [Cloud 1][5] since it was Cloud 0.98b, I’ve never used Heroku personally nor professionally. The press release was more likely written to arm the multitude of IT Ops middle management at my former workplace, those long-removed-from-the-trenches starch suits who joyfully wade through mountains of Prince2 Project Management documentation like pigs in mud. But those guys don’t use Heroku. Sure, Salesforce.com *want* them to use Heroku, but those people aren’t  even remotely in the same demographic as the majority of Heroku users singing its praises in Ruby usergroups world wide for the past 3 years.

No, Salesforce, the early adopters largley responsible for Heroku’s excellent public image are *mad* agile. Not the Agile described in your well layed-out Activity Diagram, agile like a hyperactive mako shark on crystal meth. And you just took something they love(d), and they’re afraid you’ll break it. Obviously Salesforce.com need to drop a traditional Enterprise IT press release such as this one for their audience, but they really should have lead with something to reassure Heroku’s existing users. It screams “We got this shiny thing! Look, it’s SHINY!”. Anywhere there are mentions of this acquisition, there are comments by Heroku users regarding how they’re making plans to leave.

This isn’t like when Facebook change something and an army social media zombies rage for two days then go back to Business As Usual, Heroku’s userbase know why they like Heroku and they know what it will take to build a replacement. And you know what? They probably will.
