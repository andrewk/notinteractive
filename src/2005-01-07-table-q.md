title: Quoting Tables; a Question of Semantics

Consider the following HTML snippets, each containing a table of data that has been quoted from an earlier publication. The only difference is how the source is referenced. Is there one that stands above the others? Why?
These samples are structurally complete, but totally stripped to retain focus on the placement of the citation.

#### Example 1

{% highlight html %}
<table summary="">
  <caption></caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col"></th>
      <th scope="col"></th>
      <th scope="col"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="3">Published by <cite>......</cite></td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
{% endhighlight %}

#### Example 2

{% highlight html %}
<blockquote>
	<table summary="">
		<caption></caption>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th scope="col"></th>
				<th scope="col"></th>
				<th scope="col"></th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td></td>
				<td></td>
				<td></td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	<p>Published by <cite>......</cite></p>
</blockquote>
{% endhighlight %}

#### Example 3
{% highlight html %}
    <blockquote cite="Published by ......">
    <table summary="">
    <caption></caption>
    	<thead>
    		<tr>
    			<th scope="col"></th>
    			<th scope="col"></th>
    			<th scope="col"></th>
    		</tr>
    	</thead>
    	<tbody>
    		<tr>
    			<td></td>
    			<td></td>
    			<td></td>
    		</tr>
    	</tbody>
    </table>
    </blockquote>
{% endhighlight %}

I’ve decided which one I prefer, but I’d like to hear others’ views about this. I almost forgot to mention — one example may be completely wrong.

*Many will see the obvious similarities between this post and [Dan Cederholm’s][1] “SimpleQuiz” series, however I have no intention of doing this sort of survey again so please flame/troll elsewhere. Thankyou and have a great day.*
