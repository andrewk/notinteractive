My heavily beaten righty-to-lefty convert 93/94 MIJ foto floyd Strat was in desperate need of some attention. The frets were cactus and I figured this would be a good time to get rid of the tacky fake flamed-maple finish.

You can’t see much of the body damage in the above shot, but there were a heap of places where the finish had been gouged and the wood underneath was showing.

Dismantled:

As you can see, years of exposure has faded the fake flame finish quite a bit.

Hit with 100 grit on an orbital sander:

After this, I hand-sanded down to 1200grit wet and dry.

Two coats of water-based cedar stain, sanded after each coat:

I wanted the guitar to look old and worn, without going so far as to do a lame relic job. To achieve this I sanded more stain away in areas where it would be more worn.

The Floyd Rose II bridge, which had never been cleaned:

Bridge dismantled, soaked for an hour in WD-40 and scrubbed with an old toothbrush:

The bridge came up great, and even though none of the thumb screws were tight before, they’re effortless now. It was a far easier process than I expected, I recommend it to anyone with a floyd.

Shielding, rewiring, new pot:

I only use a volume pot on this guitar and I prefer the two single coils, so I replaced the stock 500k pot with a CTS 250k. I also shielded the body with copper tape and the back of the pickguard with thick aluminum foil. I replaced the very scratched single coil pickup covers with new ones and replaced the dimarzio super distortion with the original humbucker. I’d put in the dimarzio within a year of buying the guitar (probably ’95), so the original humbucker is white enough to match the new single coil covers.

I applied one thin coat of TruOil to the body every day for a couple of weeks, lightly (LIGHTLY!) sanding with 1200 grit between each coat. Once I got to 5 coats I started using 0000 steel wool. I didn’t want a gloss finish, instead I hoped to retain the nasty look of the dented 3 piece body

Sent it off for a refret, replaced the righty locking nut with a lefty, and now it’s all done:

#### UPDATE: More Improvements

The old single coils were a bit thin, but a little bit of routing with a dremel and a pair of humbucker-sized P90′s fixed that up:
