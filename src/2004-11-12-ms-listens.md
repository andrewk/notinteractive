From an [interview][1] with Steve Vamos, Microsoft Australia’s managing director:

> I don’t believe it is a true statement that IE doesn’t have the features that our customers want. We take user feedback very seriously. If you have that feedback, then you should feed it back to us because we will feed it to the product team.

Hmmm, I thought [we][2] [already][3] [had][4]. The interview contains some hilarious quotes, especially this one:

> There are plenty of products out there with features we don’t have. We have plenty of features that our customers don’t use.

Sounds like a winning combo to me.

Then there’s [this fine piece of marketing][5] from the IE team. Wow, it’s just like watching Fox news during the US election — fair and unbiased.
