[Westciv][1] have just [announced ][2] the [results][3] of their CSS template competition. While [my entry][4] didn’t take out any of the three categories it was entered in (‘no-images’, ‘print’ and ‘handheld’) it did score me a free copy of their Style Master software! I knew I should have bought John a drink after the [WSG][5] meeting. To be honest, I’ve never tried it; but if it increases my efficiency while creating new designs I’ll become a vocal supporter of their product. I’d like to take this opportunity to publicly thank John and Maxine and wish them all the best with the upcoming release of Style Master 4 — the fact that they are an Australian company pushing the uptake of standards is all the more reason for me to wish them success!
