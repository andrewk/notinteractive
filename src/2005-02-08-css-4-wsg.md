Lea and Gary are going to kill me for leaving it this late, but here goes…

Wednesday, 9th of February (tomorrow!), I’m giving a presentation to the Brisbane [Web Standards Group][1] entitled ‘Site in an Hour — Making Complex CSS Layouts’.

If you’re in the area, why don’t you come along? I’d really like to make it more of a group discussion/brain storm than just myself standing at the front of the room blathering on like a nerd.

If you do intend on coming, **[RSVP NOW][2]**, while you still can.

For those interested but unable to attend, the presentation and the example site [are now available][3].
