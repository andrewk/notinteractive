![koala][1]You’d have to be living under a rock to not know that Victoria (where I live) has been [decimated by bush fires][2] in the past week. The worst natural disaster in Australia’s recorded history. 

Such events spark a feeling of shock, horror and utter helplessness in me. So many deaths, so much destruction, and it’s all practically on my doorstep. It’s for that reason that I was so impressed to hear around the office that [we][3] would be doing the best book deal SitePoint have ever offered to raise funds for the [Australian Red Cross Victorian Bushfire Appeal][4].

[Any 5 books (in PDF format) and for the price of 1][5], with 100% of proceeds going to charity. It’s a great offer, for a *very* worthwhile cause. 

What hasn’t been publicized is our goal for this fund-raising effort – $50,000 USD (~$75,000 AUD); which at first struck me as a lofty goal but one I was hopeful we’d surpass. As an employee a SitePoint, I have access to the sales figures and let me tell you the response so far has been astronomical. **As of right now, less than 24 hours since launching the offer, SitePoint has raised USD $61,277 for bushfire victims**.

Fuck yeah. 

And that’s with two more days to go. If you’re a web geek (and if you’re reading this you probably are), then take advantage of this offer and know that every cent is going to help people who desperately need it.
