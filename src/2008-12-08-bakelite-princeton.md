This was my first attempt at building a valve amp, and my first time working with high voltage. A *learning experience*, to say the least! I took a metric shitload of photos during the build, so this is going to be a primarily pictorial write-up.

I saw these photos of a 1940′s AWA Radiola Model 510H radio on eBay and figured it would make a pretty cool guitar amp:

I had first considered converting the existing radio amplifier circuit for use with guitar. Unfortunately the ancient components all needed replacing, the output transformer was pathetic and the power transformer was just plain dangerous. So, I gutted it and used the chassis as a basis for an entirely different amp – a “brownface” Fender Princeton (6G2 model code). Like the later "Blackface" Princetons, the 6G2 has a pair of 6V6GT power valves in push-pull configuration with bias-vary tremelo, however its preamp and tone circuits are more like the earlier "Tweed" era Fender circuits.

Having decided what amp I wanted to build, I needed to plan how it was going to fit into the chassis and the existing holes…

The layout dictated covering some of the octal valve sockets with a steel plate and punching smaller noval socket holes in their place. A healthy coat of JB Weld and some nuts & bolts did the job nicely:

So far, so good…

Then came the fun of building the circuit. First I wired up the filaments, then power supply and filtering, tone/volume pots, phase inverter and finally the tag strips in the middle containing the majority of the capacitors and resistors.

After many hours of head scratching and debugging, it’s alive! I would happily recommend this circuit to anyone. It is has a wide variety of very usable sounds, and the overdrive at higher volumes is thick, warm and crunchy, while not suffering from any top end fizz.
