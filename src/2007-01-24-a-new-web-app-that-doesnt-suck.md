[Quizlet][1] is a well thought out, well implemented educational web application that offers a focussed set of tools aimed at specific learning outcomes. Just the kind of thing I used to aim for when I was a developer at [Griffith][2], and a goal I know from experience is harder to achieve than it might sound. 

I’ll let the press release tell you what [Quizlet][1] does:

> After entering a list of vocabulary words and definitions, users are given three ways to study them: a simple flashcard method; a highly-configurable test page including written, matching, multiple-choice, and true/false questions; and a specialized “Learn” mode that tracks the userís knowledge of individual words and retests the user only on unlearned words. The siteís most innovative features include a live chat box which classmates may use to discuss vocabulary usage (or to gossip about teachers); groups that allow users to alert classmates about new sets they have entered and to edit sets collaboratively; the ability to import data from other websites and documents quickly and easily; and the ability to quickly combine word sets to study large quantities of vocabulary at once.

Created by [Andrew Sutherland][3] and tested over the past year by some of Andrew’s friends (myself included), [Quizlet][1] is a great example of using Web2.0MG concepts to enhance a quality product, instead of just creating another tag-happy circle jerk.

Check it out, I think you might like it.
