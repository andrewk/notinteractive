Creating a cranking distortion in only four steps…

Step 1 – Take a crappy delay pedal with a cool enclosure:

![Daphon delay][1]
The Unwitting Donor [cue evil laugh]

Step 2 – Gut it, drill lots of holes, and squeeze in as many pots and switches as you can manage:

![fkr-switches][2]

Step 3 – Etch and populate the Rat PCB design from [Tonepad][3], leaving room for the treasure trove of clipping mods laid out by Dano in his [FKR project][4]:

![fkr guts][5]

Step 4 – Assemble, plug in, and rock out:

![fkr side][6]

Done! Big thanks to Tonepad and Beavis Audio for the PCB design and mods.
