I picked up this broken clock for a dollar, with the intention of making it annoying. Once I saw it came with a tiny speaker, I knew it had to become some sort of noise generator.

## Part 1: Atari Punk Console

The Atari Punk Console is a classic beginners circuit. It’s basically an oscillating 555 IC, with external oscialltor adjustment. If you want to know what it sounds like, search Youtube, they all sound the same. The APC definitely meets the criteria of being annoying.

## Part 2: An Amp

I wanted more volume than the APC was capable of, so I threw together a simple 1/2 watt LM386 chipamp on some perfboard.

## Put it Together

Jam it all in the gutted clock case, convert the 2xAA compartment to a 9v battery, and done! The eyes are replaced with the APC controls, and the clock is replaced with the amp’s volume knob.

Having both an amp and the noise maker in one unit afforded the opportunity to include what is essentially an effects loop between the two:

...which means all manner of guitar effects can be inserted in between. The third 1/4 inch jack is an external speaker socket, in case you want to run this thing through a proper speaker cab. Atari Punk Pikachu is really, really annoying.
