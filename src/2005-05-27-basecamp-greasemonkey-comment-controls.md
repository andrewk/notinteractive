### What’s this all about?

[Basecamp Comment Controls][1] is a little [Greasemonkey][2] script I threw together a couple of nights back. I’m posting it here in the hope others will find it as useful as I do.

### Features

*   Adds ‘Docking’ toggle to comment form. Docked position is top right
*   Adds textarea resizing functions, including cookie-style storage of preferred height
*   Nicer textarea font
*   Auto-scroll to comment form’s position

### Future Additions

*   Clean up the rushed script
*   Make a version for Opera 8
*   Textile formatting toolbar
